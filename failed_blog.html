          interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform — we help engineers prepare for technical interviews by pairing them with senior FAANG and FAANG-adjacent engineers for mock interviews and feedback. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well for our users and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          In our survey, we gave people the following channels for getting into companies and asked them which were the most and least effective:
         </p>
         <ul class="text-md py-1 leading-5 text-[#3a3a3a]">
          <li class="text-md py-1 leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a]">

          We also asked them which types of companies they got responses from:

         <ul class="text-md py-1 leading-5 text-[#3a3a3a]">
          <li class="text-md py-1 leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a]">

          <li class="text-md py-1 leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a]">
           FAANG-adjacent (e.g., Stripe, Dropbox, OpenAI, Uber)

         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          We got ~500 responses. Among survey respondents, which channels were most effective was largely consistent, regardless of company type, but there were some twists depending on who the candidates were. More on that in a bit.

          This data came primarily from surveying experienced engineers (4+ years), rather than juniors (we don’t have that many juniors on our platform; average years of experience is 8). If you’re a junior engineer in this market, you already know you’re in for a tough time, and we’d advise you to take your destiny into your own hands as much as possible by reaching out directly to hiring managers (the same advice we give many of our more experienced users).

          You might wonder why we speculatively singled out cold outreach to hiring managers as something that can be done right, versus the other channels. In our experience, that channel is both misused and underutilized and is the best bet for many candidates, provided they do it correctly. In our next post, we’ll tell you exactly what to do and what to say when you reach out to hiring managers — especially if you come from a non-traditional background and aren’t getting a lot of recruiter outreach/don’t have the network to get warm referrals, reaching out to hiring managers is your absolute best bet.
Now let’s look at each channel in detail.

          where we asked a bunch of recruiters to look at resumes and tell us which candidates they’d want to interview. While the intent of the study was to see if recruiters are good at identifying talent (spoiler: they were barely better than a coin flip), we learned some other interesting things, including what recruiters actually look for when they read a resume.

          The two most sought-after resume traits were: 1) experience at a top-tier tech company (FAANG or FAANG-adjacent) and 2) URM (underrepresented minority) status (in tech, this means being Black or Hispanic).

          Having been a recruiter myself, I can confirm that many companies do indeed ignore their online careers page.

I found a treasure trove of candidates, including very experienced applicants from top-tier companies.

          The silver lining here is that when you don’t hear back from a company (or even when you get an automatic rejection email wishing you "the best in your future endeavors"), it’s not because a human looked at your resume and made a deliberate, thoughtful decision about you. It’s tempting to think that way because it plays so well into our insecurities. The reality is that a human probably never saw your resume in the first place.

Many companies nowadays separate referrals into "true referrals" and "leads."

          FAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies tend to rely less on agencies than startups, and when they do, it’s to fill some very specific need (rather than “Hey we need more SWEs”), so it’s not surprising that our users didn’t get much value from this channel when applying to FAANGs.

          Not all cold outreach is created equal, for two reasons. First, there’s your audience: hiring managers vs. recruiters. And then there’s the quality of the outreach itself. We’ll come back to how to write the kinds of messages that will get you responses. First, let’s talk about the audience.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          You can see in our survey results that cold outreach to hiring managers was net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and neutral for the other company types. Cold outreach to recruiters, on the other hand, was net negative for both FAANG/FAANG-adjacents and small startups and neutral for large startups.

          Ignoring the quality of the outreach for a moment, which we expect is probably comparable for both types, why does this difference exist?

          If you had to answer the question of who’s the right person to reach out to about jobs, your gut instinct might be to say it’s recruiters. After all, hiring is officially their job! However, that’s not strictly true. Recruiters are not incentivized to make hires, at least not directly. Just like everyone else, recruiters’ main priority is to keep their jobs.

          . How is that different from hiring? Hiring implies that you’re evaluated on whether the people you bring in actually get hired, but most in-house recruiters aren’t evaluated this way… because it takes too long.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          Instead, recruiters are sometimes evaluated on what portion of their candidates get offers or get to onsite. However, because of drop-off and latency (getting an offer can still take months), your organization has to be pretty good at tracking. Many are not.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          As such, many recruiting orgs prefer simpler, faster metrics:
         </p>
         <ul class="text-md py-1 leading-5 text-[#3a3a3a]">
          <li class="text-md py-1 leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a]">

          <li class="text-md py-1 leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a]">
           Of those who responded, how many resulted in a first conversation?
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          The downside of measuring success in a single part of the funnel is that you don’t incentivize people to care about what happens downstream (that is, how many are hired). This would be like if marketers only paid attention to ad clicks, rather than actual purchases. But that’s how recruiting operates: individuals aren’t really incentivized to care what happens downstream.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          So, if you are typically just measuring the response rates of your reports, as a recruiting manager, you have to set some guardrails for the types of candidates that you want your team to reach out to. If you don’t, they’ll end up just reaching out to people who are likely to respond instead of people who are a good fit for the job.

          It seems counterintuitive, but if you’re either fairly junior (fewer than 4 years of experience) or you don’t have fancy brands and schools on your resume, recruiters are not incentivized to help you because you don’t meet their criteria, and they’re not incentivized to take risks on candidates because they’re not getting rewarded when the company makes hires (or punished when the company doesn’t).

          At this point, you might be skeptical. After all, according to the graph comparing all channels, hiring manager outreach is the worst of the best. Sure, it’s net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies, but it lags behind in-house recruiters, warm referrals, and online applications with respect to effectiveness.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          Here’s the thing. Hiring manager outreach is the channel with the most untapped potential for effectiveness, while also being the one where you have the most control. Because companies often ignore them, online applications can’t come close to the same level of control, and warm referrals have a low ceiling. In-house recruiter outreach is largely out of your control (except for maybe making some limited profile tweaks, as we saw above).

          Unlike recruiters, hiring managers are actually incentivized to make hires and tend to be more open-minded about candidate backgrounds, all because hiring managers are judged on results. Specifically, they’re judged on how quickly and effectively they’re able to build stuff, and are — directly or indirectly — incentivized to grow headcount. For hiring managers, it’s not about the appearance of doing the work. It’s about the cold, hard reality of whether the work got done. And because they’re judged on actually getting stuff done, hiring managers are also much more incentivized than recruiters to take risks.
         </p>
         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">
          Outside of needing more people to build things, hiring managers are also incentivized to hire for their teams because the better they are at recruiting and filling headcount, the more likely they are to get promoted.

         <p class="py-2 text-base leading-7 text-[#3a3a3a] selection:bg-iioYellow selection:text-black sm:py-4">

             First, here’s how we got to these rankings. We asked each engineer who took our survey to rank all the channels they used to get in the door, from best to worst. Then we tallied up the points (+1 for best two channels, -1 for worst two). We didn’t do a more granular point system (e.g., +2 and -2) because the difference between the top two channels wasn’t always 2X, and generally, from talking to our users, preferences were somewhat muddy. As such, these results are directionally correct, but we didn’t feel comfortable numerically comparing them to one another. Finally, we divided the total tally by the number of times that channel came up. As a result, we were able to rank channels from most effective to least effective.

Also, even though we didn’t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and URM status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won’t hurt.

             We’d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can’t immediately tell who’s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing profiles of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a fit. That or they’re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both.

             Note that if you’re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute “founder” for “hiring manager” in the steps below. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs — they have the power to get things done and aren’t so far removed from feeling the pain of not filling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn’t make much sense — they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they’ll pass you on to one of their direct reports.

In [part 2](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-get-in-the-door-at-top-companies-cold-out-reach-to-hiring-managers-part-2), we get very tactical and tell you exactly what to say and do to get responses._\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform — we help engineers prepare for technical interviews by pairing them with senior FAANG and FAANG-adjacent engineers for mock interviews and feedback. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well for our users and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate. \n\nIn our survey, we gave people the following channels for getting into companies and asked them which were the most and least effective:\n\n* In-house recruiters contact you\n* Apply online\n* Warm referrals\n* Cold referrals\n* Cold outreach to hiring managers\n* Cold outreach to recruiters\n* Agency recruiters contact you\n\nWe also asked them which types of companies they got responses from:\n\n* FAANG\n* FAANG-adjacent (e.g., Stripe, Dropbox, OpenAI, Uber)\n* Large startups\n* Small startups\n\nWe got ~500 responses. Among survey respondents, which channels were most effective was largely consistent, regardless of company type, but there were some twists depending on who the candidates were. More on that in a bit.\n\nBelow are the channels, ranked by effectiveness.[^1] When more people found a channel effective than ineffective, it ended up in the first list. When more people found a channel to be ineffective than effective, it ended up on the second list.\n\n:::iio-appendix-panel\n\n**Recruiting channels that our users found to be effective (ranked from most to least effective):**\n\n* Warm referrals\n* In-house recruiters contact you\n* Apply online\n* Cold outreach to hiring managers\n\n**Recruiting channels that our users found to be ineffective (ranked from least to most ineffective):**\n\n* Cold outreach to recruiters\n* Cold referrals (referrals from people you don’t know)\n* Agency recruiters contact you\n\n:::\n\n\u003cp style=\"font-size:12px; font-weight:300; font-style:italic;\"\u003eThis data came primarily from surveying experienced engineers (4+ years), rather than juniors (we don’t have that many juniors on our platform; average years of experience is 8). If you’re a junior engineer in this market, you already know you’re in for a tough time, and we’d advise you to take your destiny into your own hands as much as possible by reaching out directly to hiring managers (the same advice we give many of our more experienced users). More on that later in the post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\nInterestingly, these results were quite consistent between company types. In other words, channels that worked well for FAANGs tended to work well for startups and vice versa.\n\nOverall, the most useful channels were in-house recruiters (when they reached out to you) and warm referrals. Unfortunately, both of these channels are somewhat out of your control. You have very little control over whether internal recruiters reach out to you. There are _some_ things you can do to increase the chances, but they’re all tied up in your work history and identity, neither of which you can easily change. We’ll talk more about that later on.\n\nWarm referrals (i.e., referrals from people you know), on the other hand, are very useful and are a _bit_ more in your control, but they still depend on the quality of your network.\n\nBelow is a diagram comparing the utility of all the channels to how much control you have over them.\n\n![A diagram comparing the effectiveness and utility of all the recruitment/hiring channels to how much control you have over them.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/effectiveness_and_utility_quadrant_for_channels_1c6bec37f1.png)\n\nYou might wonder why we speculatively singled out cold outreach to hiring managers as something that can be done right, versus the other channels. In our experience, that channel is both misused and underutilized and is the best bet for many candidates, provided they do it correctly. In our next post, we’ll tell you exactly what to do and what to say when you reach out to hiring managers — especially if you come from a non-traditional background and aren’t getting a lot of recruiter outreach/don’t have the network to get warm referrals, reaching out to hiring managers is your absolute best bet.\nNow let’s look at each channel in detail.\n\n### In-house recruiters contact you\n\nThis channel is one of the two where you have the least amount of control (the other is agency recruiters contacting you, though that one is way less useful).\n\nSo, how much control do you have over this channel? One bit of analysis we did on our survey data was to try to find patterns in the background of people who find in-house recruiters particularly useful. Not too surprisingly, some patterns did emerge.\n\nIn-house recruiters are most likely to contact you if:\n\n* You look good on paper, i.e., you have top-tier companies and/or schools on your resume (in our experience, companies matter more)\n* You belong to a group that’s been traditionally underrepresented in tech (i.e., you’re a woman or a person of color)\n* To _some_ extent, though less than the two bullets above, if you have niche skills (e.g., ML engineering)\n\nThese results aren’t unique to just this survey. We [recently did a study](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes) where we asked a bunch of recruiters to look at resumes and tell us which candidates they’d want to interview. While the intent of the study was to see if recruiters are good at identifying talent (spoiler: they were barely better than a coin flip), we learned some other interesting things, including what recruiters actually look for when they read a resume.\n\nThe two most sought-after resume traits were: 1) experience at a top-tier tech company (FAANG or FAANG-adjacent) and 2) URM (underrepresented minority) status (in tech, this means being Black or Hispanic).\n\nThis mirrored what we saw in our user survey when we looked at commonalities among candidates who got value from in-house recruiters.\n\nSo how do you use this information to your advantage? You obviously can’t magic FAANG/FAANG-adjacent experience or URM status out of thin air[^2], but if you do have either, our pragmatic advice is to highlight it and make it really easy for recruiters to spot. Of course, whether you _want_ to lead with URM status is a personal decision. We’ve heard differing opinions on this and are not here to judge. All we can do is share the data — do with it what you will.\n\nSo, how do you make sure that, say, your FAANG experience stands out to recruiters? Take a look at the before and after screenshots of the resume below[^3]. This resume belongs to one of our users who was kind enough to let us share it. He actually has two of the three things that recruiters look for: FAANG experience and a niche title (ML engineer). But both are buried! And the section that gets the most attention is wasted on undergraduate awards.\n\n#### Before\n\n![Before version of a resume from one of interviewing.io's users](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resume_before_b8d5aa1c34.png)\n\nAs you can see, he spent almost 3 years at Apple, but a recruiter skimming his resume might not notice that because it was a while ago. Instead, he showcases an undergrad award and some technologies/languages that he knows. Neither of those is nearly as useful to recruiters as FAANG experience.\n\nHis current title is also ML engineer, and one at the Principal level at that. But it wasn’t always: He went from back-end to SRE to a little bit of everything to ML, and because of that, it’s possible a recruiter would miss it as well.\n\n![After version of a resume from one of interviewing.io's users](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resume_after_c148ae3b62.png)\n\nWe edited this candidate’s resume to put all the things recruiters look for at the very top of the resume and moved the buzzword soup to the bottom. This candidate is obviously well-positioned because he has FAANG experience, several top schools, and niche skills — but before, many recruiters didn’t spot them. After he made these changes, the number of interviews he got increased by 8X.\n\n### Apply online\n\nIf you’ve ever applied to jobs online, then you know it’s kind of like screaming into a black hole. Though, according to our survey, some candidates (specifically people applying to FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and small startups) get some value out of this channel, it’s still a numbers game. And for large startups, it’s a losing proposition.\n\nAccording to recruiting tool Gem, applicants that come from recruiter outreach (called “outbound” in recruiter lingo) are [6 - 10X more likely to get hired](https://www.gem.com/blog/outbound-candidates-more-likely-to-be-hired) than applicants who apply online (called “inbound”). \n\nAs Lyft recruiting manager Nate Wylie put it:\n\n\u003eOur data… showed higher pass-through rates for candidates [we reached out to] at each stage of the interview process vs. applicants via the careers page. It’s not that we want to ignore applicants; it’s just that historically we don’t get what we’re looking for — and with speed — through that channel.\n\nHaving been a recruiter myself, I can confirm that many companies do indeed ignore their online careers page. Many years ago, when I first joined the recruiting team at a top-tier startup, I spent my first few days going through the resumes of people who had applied online. I found a treasure trove of candidates, including very experienced applicants from top-tier companies.[^4] But no one had seen these applicants because no one had been monitoring inbound activity for months!\n\nThe silver lining here is that when you don’t hear back from a company (or even when you get an automatic rejection email wishing you \"the best in your future endeavors\"), it’s not because a human looked at your resume and made a deliberate, thoughtful decision about you. It’s tempting to think that way because it plays so well into our insecurities. The reality is that a human probably never saw your resume in the first place.\n\nSo why do people apply online, despite knowing in their gut that it’s not an effective strategy? Simply put, it’s predictable and easy. You get into a routine, you upload your resume, you connect your LinkedIn, and you can knock out hundreds of applications in a matter of hours.\n\nThe other encouraging thing about this channel is that, when we analyzed specifically which types of candidates had success with it, we couldn’t find any patterns — the channel worked equally well (poorly?) for people who looked good on paper vs. not, and there was no preferential treatment for traditionally underrepresented groups in tech (e.g., women and people of color).\n\n**TL;DR Applying online doesn’t hurt… provided that you don’t take rejection personally. If you do, it’ll wear you down over time.**\n\n### Warm referrals\n\nWarm referrals are, of course, excellent. That is, assuming it's a _real_ referral — someone who can actually vouch for you, and ideally your work.\n\nPer capita, referrals are most companies’ best source of candidates, and they were a great channel for our users across all company types (they were the best channel for FAANGs/FAANG-adjacents, as well as large startups, and second best for small startups, behind in-house recruiters reaching out).\n\nIf you have the network, you should absolutely use it. Of course, it’s unlikely that you’ll have meaningful connections at every company you want to work at. What do you do then? \n\n### Cold referrals\n\nShould you ask people you don't know to refer you? Our survey data says probably not. Cold referrals were net negative for both FAANG and small startups and neutral for large startups.\n\nYears ago, trying to collect cold referrals was a decent strategy. You could track down someone at the company and ask them to toss your proverbial hat into the ring\n\nEngineers were often happy to refer someone — even someone they didn't know — either to be kind, to avoid the awkwardness of declining, or to collect the potential referral bonus. They couldn't vouch for you, but the referral would ensure that a human looked at your resume.\n\nThis became so common that Blind actually spun out an entire referral marketplace called [Rooftop Slushie](https://theamericangenius.com/adj/rooftop-slushie/) (the link is to some press because the actual site is now defunct), where applicants would pay a small sum for a referral. \n\nThen, companies wised up and realized that these referrals weren't all that different from normal in-bound applicants. So why treat them differently?\nMany companies nowadays separate referrals into \"true referrals\" and \"leads.\" It’s great for maintaining the delicate dance of social dynamics, but it’s completely useless for getting hired — dropping someone’s resume into the “leads” pile is basically the same as throwing it into the inbound black hole.\n\nGiven that cold referrals aren’t zero effort, our advice is to expend that energy elsewhere. More on that shortly.\n\n### Agency recruiters\n\nAgency recruiters were the worst channel overall, according to our survey, and were net negative for all company types. \n\nFAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies tend to rely less on agencies than startups, and when they do, it’s to fill some very specific need (rather than “Hey we need more SWEs”), so it’s not surprising that our users didn’t get much value from this channel when applying to FAANGs.\n\nWhile both large and small startups use agencies liberally, clearly the value to candidates is limited.[^5] Out of all of our survey respondents, only a handful of our users said that agencies were useful to them, and of those who mentioned agencies, the majority said that they were the worst channel.\n\nWe won’t belabor the point, but it’s probably not in your best interest to spend much time on working with agency recruiters. It has opportunity cost and not much upside. And you can [routinely get screwed in salary negotiations when you work with an agency recruiter](https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start), if you even get that far.\n\n### Cold outreach (to hiring managers vs. recruiters)\n\nNot all cold outreach is created equal, for two reasons. First, there’s your audience: hiring managers vs. recruiters. And then there’s the quality of the outreach itself. We’ll come back to how to write the kinds of messages that will get you responses. First, let’s talk about the audience.\n\nYou can see in our survey results that cold outreach to hiring managers was net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and neutral for the other company types. Cold outreach to recruiters, on the other hand, was net negative for both FAANG/FAANG-adjacents and small startups and neutral for large startups.\n\nIgnoring the quality of the outreach for a moment, which we expect is probably comparable for both types, why does this difference exist?\n\nIf you had to answer the question of who’s the right person to reach out to about jobs, your gut instinct might be to say it’s recruiters. After all, hiring is officially their job! However, that’s not strictly true. Recruiters are not incentivized to make hires, at least not directly. Just like everyone else, recruiters’ main priority is to keep their jobs.\n\n#### Cold outreach to recruiters doesn’t work \n\nHow does a recruiter keep their job?[^6] By _bringing in the types of candidates that their manager tasked them with_. How is that different from hiring? Hiring implies that you’re evaluated on whether the people you bring in actually get hired, but most in-house recruiters aren’t evaluated this way… because it takes too long.\n\nInstead, recruiters are sometimes evaluated on what portion of their candidates get offers or get to onsite. However, because of drop-off and latency (getting an offer can still take months), your organization has to be pretty good at tracking. Many are not.\n\nAs such, many recruiting orgs prefer simpler, faster metrics: \n\n* Of the candidates you reached out to, how many responded? \n* Of those who responded, how many resulted in a first conversation?\n\nThe downside of measuring success in a single part of the funnel is that you don’t incentivize people to care about what happens downstream (that is, how many are hired). This would be like if marketers only paid attention to ad clicks, rather than actual purchases. But that’s how recruiting operates: individuals aren’t really incentivized to care what happens downstream.\n\nSo, if you are typically just measuring the response rates of your reports, as a recruiting manager, you have to set some guardrails for the types of candidates that you want your team to reach out to. If you don’t, they’ll end up just reaching out to people who are likely to respond instead of people who are a good fit for the job.\n\nUnfortunately, you don’t know who is a good fit for the job. You can’t just say, “Go on LinkedIn, and find me good engineers.”\n\n::iio-image{alt=\"Screenshot of LinkedIn search\" height=\"704\" src=\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/linkedin_can_code_8178d2dc43.png\" title=\"LinkedIn search\" width=\"318\"}\n\nThat doesn’t exist. So instead, you come up with some rules that look like this:\n\n* Senior engineers\n    * Juniors and intermediate engineers would answer outreach a lot, but they already apply online in droves, so we don’t need to pay people to go out and find them. Moreover, we have a whole university department that deals with college hires once a year in September.\n* Went to a top school (in the absence of a better filter, this works OK)\n* Worked at a top company\n\nThere may be a few other items on the list if the role requires specific skills (e.g., Android development), but by and large, that’s what recruiters are tasked with, and that’s what they’re focused on.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but if you’re either fairly junior (fewer than 4 years of experience) or you don’t have fancy brands and schools on your resume, recruiters are not incentivized to help you because you don’t meet their criteria, and they’re not incentivized to take risks on candidates because they’re not getting rewarded when the company makes hires (or punished when the company doesn’t).\n\n**What does this mean for you? If you’re not the type of candidate that recruiters are reaching out to already (senior, well-pedigreed), they will not help you.**\n\nWith that sad reality in mind, here’s the good news: there _is_ someone who’s actually incentivized to make hires and is much more open-minded: the hiring manager[^7]!\n\n#### Cold outreach to hiring managers is effective\n\nAt this point, you might be skeptical. After all, according to the graph comparing all channels, hiring manager outreach is the worst of the best. Sure, it’s net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies, but it lags behind in-house recruiters, warm referrals, and online applications with respect to effectiveness.\n\nHere’s the thing. Hiring manager outreach is the channel with the most untapped potential for effectiveness, while also being the one where you have the most control. Because companies often ignore them, online applications can’t come close to the same level of control, and warm referrals have a low ceiling. In-house recruiter outreach is largely out of your control (except for maybe making some limited profile tweaks, as we saw above).\n\nWhy is this the right channel?\n\nUnlike recruiters, hiring managers are actually incentivized to make hires and tend to be more open-minded about candidate backgrounds, all because hiring managers are judged on results. Specifically, they’re judged on how quickly and effectively they’re able to build stuff, and are — directly or indirectly — incentivized to grow headcount. For hiring managers, it’s not about the appearance of doing the work. It’s about the cold, hard reality of whether the work got done. And because they’re judged on actually getting stuff done, hiring managers are also much more incentivized than recruiters to take risks. \n\nOutside of needing more people to build things, hiring managers are also incentivized to hire for their teams because the better they are at recruiting and filling headcount, the more likely they are to get promoted. \n\nAs such, in our minds, when people say that hiring manager outreach hasn’t worked for them, it’s because they’re not doing it right. So, how do you do it?\n\nIn our next post, we’ll get very practical about outreach, provide a bunch of examples of good and bad outreach, and share two templates that you can steal.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[^1]: First, here’s how we got to these rankings. We asked each engineer who took our survey to rank all the channels they used to get in the door, from best to worst. Then we tallied up the points (+1 for best two channels, -1 for worst two). We didn’t do a more granular point system (e.g., +2 and -2) because the difference between the top two channels wasn’t always 2X, and generally, from talking to our users, preferences were somewhat muddy. As such, these results are directionally correct, but we didn’t feel comfortable numerically comparing them to one another. Finally, we divided the total tally by the number of times that channel came up. As a result, we were able to rank channels from most effective to least effective. \n[^2]: This is why I generally view resume writers as selling snake oil. Either you have the things recruiters are looking for or you don’t. If you don’t, no amount of wordsmithing your bullet points or reorganizing the page is going to make a significant difference. Sure, [check your resume for typos](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/), and make sure that it reads decently well. Any more time invested in your resume after those basic things will have diminishing returns. Beware of anyone who tells you otherwise, and beware of any products or services who charge for resume review.\n[^3]: We realize that recruiters won’t always have access to your resume when doing outreach and are likely looking at your LinkedIn instead. The same advice stands. Make sure that your About section has all the most important tidbits about you, front and center. Also, even though we didn’t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and URM status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won’t hurt.\n[^4]: Of course we don’t share the point of view that you can only be a good candidate if you have a brand-name company on your resume. However, many recruiters do, and they are still ignoring this channel.\n[^5]: We’d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can’t immediately tell who’s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing profiles of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a fit. That or they’re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both.\n[^6]: At larger companies, recruiting is usually split into two functions: sourcing (these are the people who reach out to candidates) and recruiting (these are the people who manage candidates’ journey through the process and extend offers). In this post, for simplicity, we’re lumping them together because separating them out would change some of the details but wouldn’t change the key takeaways.\n[^7]: Note that if you’re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute “founder” for “hiring manager” in the steps below. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs — they have the power to get things done and aren’t so far removed from feeling the pain of not filling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn’t make much sense — they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they’ll pass you on to one of their direct reports.\n","excerpt":"interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform — we help engineers prepare for technical interviews. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate.\n\nNot surprisingly, warm referrals are the best way in. On the other hand, agency recruiters are clearly the worst. But not all channels are created equal. Some, like recruiters contacting you, you have minimal control over, and whether you get contacted is largely a function of whether you have top brands on your resume or belong to an underrepresented group. With others, like reaching out to hiring managers, you are fully in control of your destiny.
